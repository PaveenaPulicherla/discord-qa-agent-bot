# Reflection

Building this Discord bot helped me understand how agentic systems can be decomposed into modular capabilities that work together to support a larger workflow. Each command represents a core component of an AI QA & Governance agent.

This project reinforced the importance of clear inputs, structured outputs, and predictable behavior—key principles in QA and governance. It also demonstrated how conversational interfaces can make agentic systems more accessible to non-technical users.

The experience will help me design more advanced agents using enterprise tools such as Microsoft Copilot Extensions.
